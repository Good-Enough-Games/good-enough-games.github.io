# Escape Area 51

(working title)

_Created by Caitlin Mallen, Jayden Tactay, and Rob Godfrey_

### Concept
_Escape Area 51_ is a 2.5D game based in Area 51 where the player is an alien trying to escape captivity. The player tries to avoid getting caught by guards and makes their way to an exit to meet up with an alien rescue squad waiting in their spaceship. The alien has the power to transform into guards or objects to escape detection.

**Emotion/Mood**

A fun and lighthearted game with (maybe) comical violence

**Goals**

- Make it to the exit without getting captured
- Avoid detection (or kill/disable once detected)
- Solve puzzles to access certain areas (make use of guards and items)

**Obstacles**

- Guards chase the player (line of sight, proximity for hearing)
- Security cameras
- Impassable checkpoints that the player normally can’t get through
- Puzzles

**Rules**

- Guards patrol on set path and will chase the player if detected
- Checkpoints save player progress
- Any aliens that are saved will join the player as part of their team (maybe)
- Use special transformation powers to avoid or trick guards, or access other areas
- Start with limited transformation abilities, gain more each level

**Level Progression**

- Harder obstacles closer to exit (i.e., each floor)
- New forms of movement on different floors
- Each floor favors a different object

**Interaction/Feedback**

- WASD to move
- Other forms of movement for each object
- Guards chase when hearing/seeing you
- Have to see/touch an object to transform
- “Health” system

**Suspense in Achieving Goals**

- More guards the longer you take?
- AI gets harder the more you progress
- Cooldown in Alien Powers
- Can only transform for so long

**Rewards**

- New objects to transform into
- New alien powers for each alien saved
